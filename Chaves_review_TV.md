Review for Taylor Vroman

Hello Taylor, I have some comments on your R assignment:

1. The HTML format gives an organized way to visualize every detail inside your project. Also you added some extra information to explain what you are trying to do in every command line, which is very helpful for people who are not familiar with the R class. However, I was not able to run the code on R because I couldnt find a way to run HTML. I would suggest you also attach a readme.md file or an R markdown file in order to run it faster and interactively.

2. Your way of the step-by-step process is very similar to mine, so I donÂ´t have big comments on the command itself. 

3. I would like to be able see the plots.

4. To keep your repository organized it would be good idea to put the created files inside a folder.

Thank you for sharing your assignment!
